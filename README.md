EEG DATA ANALYSIS FOR DETECTING RELAXATION AND CONCENTRATION MOODS

Capstone project

The project is about to analyze brain signals and detecting the relaxation and concentration moods of the 
signals by time, by using Machine Learning Methods. The system needs a proper data before using machine 
learning and this side will be done by the biomedical engineering but after that the selected Machine Learning
Model will predict the new brain signals and the results will be shown with a graph.
